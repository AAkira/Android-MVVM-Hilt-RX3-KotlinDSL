# Android-MVVM-Hilt-RX3-KotlinDSL


A Tiny Mobile Application
<br>
This is a simple Android sample app which implemented using MVVM architecture,
Retrofit2, RX3, Coil, Hilt, View Binding and Kotlin DSL.
At the moment, it has a simple structure but It will be more complicated if needed.
I used `https://www.omdbapi.com/` for the content of app through a simple UI.
My goal of sharing this code is to get feedback, find problems and improve the implementation.
So I`ll be very happy to hear from you!
